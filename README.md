# SPINNINGMIXER_PROJECT
Repo for Data Science I project.

# PRJECT 01 TO DO LIST:

 - [ ] Enable a “bot” called Jarvis inside your team workspace using Slack’s API.
 - [ ] Create a Python script to power Jarvis that can receive messages from Slack, react to messages based on their contents, and send messages of its own back to Slack.
 - [ ] Instantiate the necessary behavior of Jarvis in your Python code. In particular, Jarvis must remember its current state (where it is in a conversation) when new messages are received and respond to messages with particular contents.
 - [ ] Devise a small database that Jarvis can store some of the data it receives during certain conversations.
 - [ ] Use the completed Jarvis to generate natural language (text) data and save this text to the
database.
